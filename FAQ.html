                        <div class="panel">
                            <p>We are a graphic design agency with workers that are capable to make any type of design
                                you require.</p>

                        <div class="panel">
                            <p>Working with us is really easy, when you contact us, you tell us as many details about
                                what you need, you make the payment and we take care of the rest. Our team of workers is
                                quite large to carry out different types of animations, designs, etc.</p>

                            accept?</h2>
                        <div class="panel">
                            <p>We charge for each finished design / animation depending on its difficulty. As currency
                                we only handle the US dollar. The way of payment can be agreed with the client, but
                                generally it is through PayPal, because it is a platform that allows secure payments.

                        <div class="panel">
                            <p>We currently have an incredible discount that will allow you to save $10 for a project
                                that we do for you. You can earn them if you refer a person to our agency, the only
                                condition is that your referral must complete a project with us. (the $10 are not
                                cumulative and is $10 per person, not per project)</p>

                        <div class="panel">
                            <p>Yes. We have managed a wide variety of projects, and we can provide you with an advisory
                                to focus yours on what best suits your needs.</p>

                        <div class="panel">
                            <p>It takes about 3-5 business days. This time varies only if the project is highly complex,
                                for example an animated video made from scratch.</p>

                        <div class="panel">
                            <p>We aim to represent your design or animation as accurately as possible, therefore we
                                accept small changes to the final project. We do not make changes where many things need
                                to be changed. If you want this, you must pay an extra stipulated by the agency.</p>
